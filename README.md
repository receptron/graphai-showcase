# GraphAI Showcase

Hey GraphAI wizards 🧙‍♀️👾  
Welcome to the **GraphAI Showcase** — a curated gallery of community-powered graph data! 🌌🧠

Wanna show off your creation? Just follow these steps:

1. **Create a folder** like `category/appName` 📁  
   Example: `ai-agents/idea-generator`

2. **Add your graph file**, named something cool like `graph.yaml` ⚙️  
   It should follow the GraphAI format and describe your app’s structure.

3. **Write a `README.md`** to explain:  
   - What your graph does 🧠  
   - Why it’s useful or interesting 💡  
   - How to run it or explore it locally ⚙️  
   - (Optional but awesome) Add a demo GIF or screenshot! 📸🎥

4. **Include code**, if needed:  
   - Add `.ts` files to run your graph locally  
   - Use `package.json` if your setup has dependencies

5. **Add tags** to help categorize your graph ✨  
   Just include them at the top of your `README.md`, like:

   **Tags:** #agent #chatbot #toolformer #experimental
